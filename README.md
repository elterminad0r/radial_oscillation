# radial\_oscillation
A processing project on the graphing of polar functions for r in theta and time
by using successively more oscillating points on straight lines, inspired by
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/82nbra/every_line_is_straight/)
post.

It's currently not very adaptable, the main problem being that it doesn't
necessarily know the period of a given function (eg given r = sin(theta/3 + t),
it has to plot theta from 0 to 6pi). This is also the function it's currently
set up to draw. Here are some screenshots of it as it progresses:
